// // Instead of using the in-memory array on which we don't have a lot of control like mutation. 
// We will create a class to manage the game state, which is called as singleton pattern.
// In singleton pattern, we ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

// ðŸ“Œ Explanation Paragraph
// The Singleton pattern in this GameManager class ensures that only one instance of GameManager exists across the entire application. By making the constructor private, no other part of the code can directly create a new instance of GameManager. Instead, the static getInstance() method checks if an instance already exists; if it does, it returns the same one, otherwise, it creates a new instance. This guarantees that all parts of the program share the same games array and state, making it ideal for managing global resources such as active chess games.
